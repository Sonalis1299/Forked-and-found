# 🍴 Forked and Found

**Forked and Found** is a web platform designed to reduce food waste by helping users discover creative recipes from leftover or near-expiry ingredients. It promotes sustainability and food sharing by allowing users to either cook meals based on what's available or share extra food with others in need.

## 🛠 Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **challenge/**  
   This folder contains the main web interface that helps users generate recipe ideas based on available ingredients using flavor pairing data and recipe databases. It also integrates with a chatbot for mental health check-ins.

2. **shareaplate/**  
   This folder powers the community feature where users can post and discover food sharing opportunities in their locality — think of it like a mini social platform for food sharing.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

To run both parts of the project simultaneously:

### 1. Open two terminal windows/tabs.

### 2. In the first terminal:
```bash
cd challenge
npm install     # Run this if not already done

```
### 3. In the Second Terminal
